The IPFSdemo project will have rust implementations of aspects of (my understanding of) IPFS and
p2p networking, writing p2p implementations and or using p2p libraries.

This project should contain cryptography, and cryptographic primitives both imported and
written from scratch. The project will also contain network routing both from libraries
and written from scratch. I'm not sure if I can create a VLAN or some kind of local network
to assign IP addresses for the modules to use.

Modules to write
    - Define an IPFS Node ??
    - encrypt data to be stored and connect the key to the data being stored for later use
    - hash data to give it a unique address
    - some kind of ZKproof?
    - Send data over some protocol to another node with a given IP
